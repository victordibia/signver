## Training Signver Models on the Habana Gaudi Accelerator

This document describes how some of the deep learning models that enable Signver can be _rapidly trained_ using the Habana Gaudi Accelerator on AWS.

The Signver library utilizes 3 deep learning models for several aspects of its functionality. Signature object detection (framed as an object detection task), signature cleaning (framed as an image translation task) and representation extraction (framed as a representation learning problem).
